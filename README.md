Here you may find (or not) several C# scripts i've written for a litte unity game i'm working on. Feel free to use them, if they're any good.

What's available atm:

- CameraController.cs
  
  This is a camera script for unity. You'll have to add some axes inside the Input Manager to use the script. Furthermore you'll need an additional gameobject besides the camera to use this script. Add the camera as a child and the script to that gameobject. You'll have to assign the camera to the variable Camera. The camera's rotation and position is based on calculations in spherical coordinates, where the gameobject is the center of a sphere with changing radius (changed by the user) and the camera is traversing along that sphere's boundaries.

- PriorityQueue.cs

  For review.

Cheers,
